# git-yolo

You only live once.

As they say, commit often, perfect later (I feel like I'm missing a part of the phrase. Oh well, it's probably nothing)...

## Installation

(if the install script is not available yet)

1. Download the source code (or download the binary and skip to step 3)
2. Compile using `go build git-yolo.go`
3. Add the resulting `git-yolo` binary to your path
4. Add an alias for `git yolo` in your [global] `.gitconfig`

## Why

Why not?

Also, it gave me a reason to write a project in Go.
